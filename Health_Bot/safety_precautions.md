Travel Safety Precautions and Recommendations for Dhaka in October 2023:

1. **Clothing and Packing:**
   - **Lightweight and Breathable Clothing:** Considering the average high temperatures range from 89°F to 87°F with high humidity, pack lightweight, breathable fabrics such as cotton or linen to keep cool.
   - **Layered Clothing Options:** Nights can be cooler with temperatures decreasing to 72°F, so include a light sweater or jacket for evening outings.
   - **Rain Protection Gear:** With around 7 days of expected rainfall, carry an umbrella, a light raincoat, or a waterproof jacket.
   - **Sun Protection Accessories:** Given the high UV levels, it's advisable to pack sunglasses, a wide-brimmed hat, and sunscreen with a high SPF rating.

2. **Health Precautions:**
   - **Hydration:** Due to high humidity levels, ensure you stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day.
   - **Insect Repellent:** As the weather transitions from monsoon to drier winter months, mosquito activity can still be present. Pack an effective insect repellent to avoid mosquito bites and protect against mosquito-borne diseases.

3. **Travel and Safety Tips:**
   - **Stay Informed:** Although there are no severe weather warnings currently, monitor local weather updates for any sudden changes or advisories.
   - **Sun Protection:** Limit sun exposure during midday when UV radiation peaks, and stay in shaded areas when possible.

4. **Things to Avoid:**
   - **Avoid Overpacking Warm Clothes:** Dhaka's October climate does not require heavy winter clothing, so avoid carrying bulky warm items. 
   - **Outdoor Activities during Rain:** Plan outdoor activities for the 20 sunny days and avoid them during the expected rainy days to ensure safety and enjoyment.

Travelers to Dhaka should prepare for warm, humid days and cooler nights, with some rainy periods, ensuring a comfortable and safe visit. Always be alert to local advisories and adjust plans if unexpected weather conditions arise.
