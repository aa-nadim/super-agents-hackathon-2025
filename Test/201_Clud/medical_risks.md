Travelers to Dhaka, Bangladesh should be aware of several potential medical risks and take preventive measures to safeguard their health:

1. **Vaccinations**:
   - **Hepatitis A and Typhoid**: Vaccinations are essential as these diseases can be transmitted through contaminated food and water.

   - **Cholera**: In specific instances, particularly if staying in areas where sanitation is poor.

2. **Insect-borne Diseases**:
   - **Dengue Fever**: A mosquito-borne disease that can occur year-round. Use insect repellent, wear long sleeves, and stay in accommodations with window screens or air-conditioning.
